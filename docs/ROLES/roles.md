# Role-Permission Matrix

## Overview
This matrix defines which user roles can perform which actions in the WineMarket system. This is the **source of truth** for authorization logic throughout the application.

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Full access
- ❌ = No access
- 🔒 = Own resources only (user's own data)
- ⚙️ = Conditional/Admin approval required

## Key Business Rules

### Role Acquisition
- **Guest** → **Customer**: Automatic upon registration (AU-1)
- **Customer** → **Winemaker**: Submit request (AU-6) → Admin approval → role activated
- **Customer** → **Shop Owner**: Submit request (AU-7) → Admin approval → role activated
- One user can hold multiple roles simultaneously (e.g., Customer + Winemaker + Shop Owner)

### Resource Ownership (🔒)
- **Own wine** = Created by logged-in Winemaker
- **Own shop** = Owned by logged-in Shop Owner
- **Own order** = Created by logged-in Customer/Winemaker/Shop Owner
- **Own product** = Added to shop by logged-in Shop Owner
- **Own bundle** = Created by logged-in Shop Owner

### Admin Override
- Admin can perform any action (✅ everywhere)
- Admin bypasses all ownership checks
- Admin can approve/reject events and role requests
- Admin can moderate content

### Special Cases
- **Checkout**: Only authenticated users (❌ for Guest)
- **Event Registration**: Only authenticated users, max 1 registration per user
- **Create Event**: Winemakers can create, but events need Admin approval before publication (EV-7)
- **Order Management**: Shop Owner sees only orders for their shop; Admin sees all
