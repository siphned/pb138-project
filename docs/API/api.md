# API Endpoint Design — WineMarket

## Overview
This document specifies all REST API endpoints for the WineMarket platform. Each endpoint is mapped to:
- HTTP method & path
- Request/response schemas (Zod-based)
- Authorization requirements (from `docs/roles.md`)
- Database operations (repository layer)

**Technology**: Elysia + Zod + OpenAPI → Auto-generated documentation via Scalar

**Notes on Authorization:**
- `❌` = Public, no authentication required
- `✅` = Authentication required (JWT token)
- `✅ (Admin)` = Admin role only
- `✅ (own)` = Own resource or Admin
- `✅ (WINEMAKER)` = Winemaker role required
- `✅ (SHOP_OWNER)` = Shop Owner role required

## Module: CARTS & ORDERS
**Responsibility**: Shopping cart, checkout, orders

**Cart Notes:** The server only stores carts for authenticated users (JWT required for all cart endpoints). There is no server-side guest cart. Guest cart functionality must be implemented on the **frontend** using `localStorage` — items added while unauthenticated are stored locally, then synced to the server via `POST /carts/merge` immediately after login. **This frontend localStorage cart is not yet implemented.**

| Method | Path | Description | Auth |
|--------|------|---|---|
| GET | `/carts/me` | Get current user's cart (creates if none) | ✅ |
| POST | `/carts/items` | Add item to cart (accumulates if already present) | ✅ |
| PUT | `/carts/items/:id` | Update cart item quantity | ✅ |
| DELETE | `/carts/items/:id` | Remove item from cart | ✅ |
| POST | `/carts/merge` | Merge guest localStorage items into user cart on login | ✅ |
| POST | `/orders` | Checkout — convert cart to order, clears cart | ✅ |
| GET | `/orders` | List current user's orders | ✅ |
| GET | `/orders/:id` | Get order by ID (own orders only) | ✅ |
| PUT | `/orders/:id/items/:itemId/status` | Update individual order item status | ✅ (SHOP_OWNER) |

**Checkout body:** `paymentMethod`, `deliveryType`, plus either `shippingAddressId` (existing) or `newShippingAddress` (inline object), same for billing. Stock is validated at checkout time.

**Order item statuses:** `pending` → `confirmed` → `shipped` → `delivered` (terminal). `cancelled` is also terminal. Shop owners can only update items belonging to their shop.

## Revision History
- **v1.0** (Week 6) — Initial API design from PRD requirements
- **v1.1** (Week 9, WINE-79) — Admin module: event moderation moved from /events to /admin/events; user deactivate replaced with full status lifecycle (active/suspended/banned); review admin endpoints added under /admin/reviews; role-request admin routes removed (live at /role-requests without prefix); GET /admin/statistics deferred
- **v1.2** (Week 10, WINE-65) — Carts & Orders implemented: paths changed from /cart to /carts/me; PUT replaces PATCH for item updates; guest cart is localStorage-only (no server sessions) with POST /carts/merge for login sync; order status update is per-item (PUT /orders/:id/items/:itemId/status) not per-order; /shops/:id/orders and DELETE /cart (clear) not implemented
