# API Endpoint Design — WineMarket

## Overview
This document specifies all REST API endpoints for the WineMarket platform. Each endpoint is mapped to:
- HTTP method & path
- Request/response schemas (Zod-based)
- Authorization requirements (from `docs/roles.md`)
- Database operations (repository layer)

**Technology**: Elysia + Zod + OpenAPI → Auto-generated documentation via Scalar
